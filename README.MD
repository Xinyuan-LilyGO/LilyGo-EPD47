# FAQ

- IO0 has been used and cannot be programmed.
- How to turn off the blue LED light?
    - To turn off the blue LED, you must call `epd_poweroff_all()`, which will turn off the entire power supply controlled by PWM_EN. Note that it cannot be turned off when powered by USB. It can only be turned off when powered by battery. For details, refer to [examples/demo](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47/tree/master/examples/demo)
