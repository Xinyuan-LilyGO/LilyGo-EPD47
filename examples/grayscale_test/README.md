Simple firmware for ESP32 to display grayscale on EPaper screen.

## ESP-IDF

You need to install the `quilt` tool and execute `quilt push -a` in the current directory, which will automatically generate the `esp-idf` project file.

## 关于ESP32-S3

When using the `arduino` environment, the program may crash and restart frequently.

This is not the case with the development environment using `esp-idf`.

The reason for this occurrence has not yet been found.

If you know what the problem is, please let me know.
